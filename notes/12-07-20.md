## FADE IN:

EXT. FERRY INTERIOR - MID-DAY - ESTABLISHING

Billy and Sam, laptops open, travelling by catamaran to the Croatian isle of Rab.


## admin module
- nameservice template

## launching
- before you launch a chain you need a few tx
- auth module in charge of user account
- bank module imports this

## accounts + transacting
- you need to have had an account at one time
- tx fee of 0 is possible
- check that account exists before sending
- look at desmos' profile code

# venue
- private discord channel possible?
- maybe start with slack
- build up to full slack click functionality, start with `/send` + command line

# introspection
- something to list all accounts and addresses
- microtick did work on "top score" - may be 2nd layer
- use block explorer to look at recent txs / general stats

```
/nick [handle]
/account [address]
/balance [account / handle]
  real
  ghost
/balances --denom
/send [account / handle]
```

- would be ideal to make engineers deal with gas
